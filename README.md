# CustomOCRModel

An optical character recognition (OCR) model specifically designed to succeed at reading characters written by me. This
model was created using a TensorFlow Convolutional Neural network. The data (not included in this repo) was a mixture of
characters from the EMNIST ByClass dataset, and characters handwritten by myself.

A variety of data mixtures were examined to find the optimal ratio (EMNIST data : user data). For more information, read
the research paper included in this repo.
